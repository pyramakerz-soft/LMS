                                                 Infrared sensors detect heat and sense
                                                 objects based on thermal emissions, making
                                                 them useful for temperature measurements
                                                 and motion detection, even in the dark.



                An ultrasonic sensor measures distance by emitting high-frequency
                sound waves and calculating the time it takes for the echo to return after
                bouncing o  an object. It is commonly used in applications like obstacle
                detection, level measurement, and robotic navigation.

             1. Which sensor type is generally more accurate for precise
                 distance measurements?

                A) IR sensor.
                B) Ultrasonic sensor.
                C) Both are equally accurate.
                D) Neither is accurate for distance measurements.


             2. What is a potential limitation of IR sensors?

                A) They can't work in dark environments.
                B) They are a ected by ambient light.
                C) They can't detect objects at all.
                D) They only work with metal objects.


             3. Ultrasonic sensors measure distance by:

                A) Analyzing color patterns.
                B) Detecting heat signatures.
                C) Measuring the time it takes for sound waves to bounce back.
                D) Counting the number of light re ections.

             Create a simple circuit of a IR sensor, led , resistance with
             battery and wire on a breadboard.



             Try to reverse the terminals of the IR sensor and notice
             what will happen.
