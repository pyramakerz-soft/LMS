Project Overview                 Project Overview                      Adam and Laila's school organized a  eld trip to an industrial                 area, where they visited a soda factory. Everything was going                 smoothly until the sorting machine malfunctioned, leading to a                 pile-up of soda cans.                      The current machine is                 unable to sort the cans                 accurately by height,                 causing production                 delays and ine ciencies.                   Your class has been                 assigned the task of                 developing a solution to                   x the sorting problem.                                                                                  04","Learning Objectives                    By the end of the theme students will be able to:                         Identify key components of a height sorting machine,including                       sensors, motors, and the sorting mechanism.                        Explain the interactions between these components and                       theirinterdependence.                        Recognize di erent sensor types (e.g., ultrasonic, infrared)and their                       applications in sorting machines.                        Analyse how coding structures a ect the performance andaccuracy                       of the sorting machine.                        Discuss the importance of precise measurements andcalibration for                       sorting e ciency.                         Investigate the properties of materials used in sortingmachines and                       their suitability for construction.                        Understand the relationship between an object's length andsorting                       criteria.                         Explore measurement accuracy principles and their relevanceto                       sorting algorithms.                         Analyse factors like sensor placement and motor control thatimpact                       sorting e ectiveness.                         Apply measurement accuracy and motor control principles                       tooptimize the sorting machine.                       Project Task:                 Use the Engineering Design                Process to assist Adam and Laila                 in designing and building a color                sorting system to  x the                malfunctioning candy sorter at                the factory.                                                                     05"];
