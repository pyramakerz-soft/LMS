            We have di erent items like blocks, sticks,
            rods, cylinders, and rectangular prisms.
            We also have three bins: one for Short,
            one for Medium, and one for Tall. Can you
            help me put each item into the right bin?

             Choose the correct answer:


             1. What is the primary purpose of a height sorting machine?

                A) To measure the weight of objects.
                B) To measure the height of objects and sort them accordingly.
                C) To change the color of objects.
                D) To heat objects to a certain temperature.


             2. Which sensor is commonly used with Arduino to measure
                  the height of objects?

                A) Temperature sensor.
                B) Light sensor.
                C) Ultrasonic sensor.
                D) Pressure sensor.



             3. In an Arduino-based height sorting machine,
                 What does the ultrasonic sensor do?

                A) It measures the weight of the object.
                B) It detects the color of the object.
                C) It measures the distance to the object, which is used to
                    calculate the height.
                D) It records the temperature of the object.
