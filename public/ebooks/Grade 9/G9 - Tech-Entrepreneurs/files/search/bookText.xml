               Designing and Managing a Tech-Driven Co ee Shop


                   Introduction

                   Imagine stepping into a co ee shop where technology enhances every
                   aspect of the experience - from a custom-designed co ee machine
                   built by you to digital ordering systems and e cient business
                   management strategies. In this project, you will act as an
                   entrepreneur tasked with designing and managing a co ee shop. The
                   government has provided space for a new co ee shop, but with a
                   twist: instead of purchasing an existing co ee machine, you’ll design
                   and build one yourself. Why? Because designing your own machine
                   allows you to create a device that perfectly suits your shop’s unique
                   needs, incorporates innovative features, and reduces dependency on
                   pre-made, often expensive, machines. This project will integrate
                   business strategy with design, electronics, robotics, and programming
                   to build a functional co ee shop model from the ground up.




                   Mission

                   Your mission is to create a pro table, tech-driven co ee shop. You'll
                   integrate business planning with modern technology to ensure
                   operational e ciency, excellent customer service, and overall
                   pro tability.




                   Scenario Context


                   Who: Entrepreneurs responsible for managing their own co ee shop.
                   What: Develop a business plan and incorporate innovative technology
                   into the shop’s operations.
                   Where: The space provided by the government, with potential
                   expansion to online platforms.
                   When: Simulate the process of launching a co ee shop in a competitive
                   market.
                   Why: To understand how to establish a pro table and operationally
                   e cient co ee shop, utilizing innovative design and technology
                   solutions.

                 2.  Utilize Fusion 360 to design essential co ee machine components, such as heat
                     distribution systems and water  ow mechanisms.

                 3.  Understand circuit design principles for automating water pumps and push-button
                     systems in co ee machines.
                 4.  Implement digital inputs/outputs and control logic for automating the water pumps using
                     Arduino.
                 5.  Design functional circuits using Arduino to control water pumps, ensuring they start/stop
                     with appropriate inputs.
                 6.  Understand the di erence between UI (User Interface) and UX (User Experience) design.

                 7.  Explain how UI/UX principles in uence the usability and engagement of a mobile app in a
                     co ee shop setting.

                 8.  Use HTML to create the structure of a fully-functional co ee shop website, including
                     sections like the homepage, menu, about page, and contact forms.


                 Your Challenge

                 By the end of this project, you’ll have:

                   Developed a complete business plan and feasibility study for a new co ee shop, analyzing
                   market opportunities and  nancial requirements.

                   Designed key components of a co ee machine using Fusion 360 and created an automated
                   water pump system using Arduino.

                   Programmed Arduino circuits to control the co ee machine’s water  ow with push-button
                   functionality.

                   Created a mobile app or website to manage customer interactions and orders, applying
                   UI/UX design principles for a smooth user experience.
                   Presented your co ee shop plan and prototype to a panel, showcasing how your business
                   can successfully operate with a combination of entrepreneurial strategy and technology.

                                              A Printed Circuit Board (PCB) is a  at board used to
                                              connect and hold electronic components. It is made of
                                              a solid material, usually  berglass, with thin copper
                                              layers that form pathways for electricity. These
                                              pathways replace wires and help connect components
                                              like resistors, capacitors, and chips. PCBs are used in
                                              almost all electronic devices, such as computers,
                                              phones, and TVs, because they make circuits compact,
                                              reliable, and easy to produce.

              What was one of the main challenges with early electronic circuits that
              led to the invention of printed circuit boards (PCBs)?
              A) They were too simple to be e ective.
              B) They were di cult to repair and scale up due to manual wiring.
              C) They were too expensive to manufacture.
              D) They required too many components to function.


              Why is a resistive mask applied to the copper plate before etching in
              the PC?

              A) To enhance the color of the PCB.
              B) To protect certain areas of the copper from being etched away.
              C) To improve the mechanical strength of the PCB.
              D) To facilitate the soldering of components.

              Why is the solder mask typically green, and what is its primary
              function?

              A) It is green to match the aesthetic of electronic devices and prevents
                  oxidation.
              B) It is green to signify that the PCB is ready for assembly and protects
                  against dust.
              C) It is green to indicate the quality of the copper traces and to insulate
                  the board.

                                            Integrated Circuit (IC) is a small electronic
                                            component made of multiple tiny
                                            electronic parts like transistors, resistors,
                                            and diodes, all combined into a single
                                            chip.





               It performs speci c tasks or operations in an electronic
               circuit, such as logic operations, signal processing, or memory
               storage.





                Logic Gates:


               1.  AND Gate

                       Combines two or more inputs.
                       The output is ON (1) only when all inputs are ON (1).
                       Example: A light turns on only if two switches are
                       pressed.

               2.  NOT Gate


                       Has a single input.
                       The output is the opposite of the input.
                       Example: If the input is ON (1), the output is OFF (0).


               3.  NOR Gate

                       Combines two or more inputs.
                       The output is ON (1) only when all inputs are OFF (0).
                       Example: A warning light stays o  unless both
                       conditions (like temperature and pressure) are safe.
