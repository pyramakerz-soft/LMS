                 Okay class your friends Adam and
                 Laila need the help of some clever and
                 creative minds to design a propeller
                 that would make the outer zoom
                 across the water and move smoothly
                 on the ground can you help them?

               What is a key factor in designing a propeller           Which blade shape might reduce
               for the Flouter?                                        drag and increase eciency?
                 a) Color.              c) Size of the vehicle.          a) Straight.   c) Square.
                 b) Number of blades. d) Type of fuel.                   b) Curved.     d) Triangular.

               How does the number of blades aect a propeller's performance?
                  a) More blades always make it faster.
                  b) Fewer blades make it more colorful.
                  c) The number of blades can aect stability and thrust.
                  d) More blades make it heavier.
