                       Identify the key components of an ecosystem, including biotic and
                       abiotic factors.


                       Explain the interactions and interdependence between the
                       components of an ecosystem.

                       Recognize the various types of pollution
                       (e.g., plastic, chemical, noise) that can negatively impact ecosystems.


                       Analyze the e ects of di erent pollutants on the health and balance
                       of ecosystems.


                       Discuss the importance of protecting and preserving  ecosystems to
                       maintain biodiversity and ecological sustainability.


                       Investigate the physical and mechanical properties of di erent
                       materials, including density.


                       Determine the suitability of various materials for constructing objects
                       based on their properties.

                       Explain the relationship between an object's density and its ability to
                        oat or sink in water.


                       Understand the principles of buoyancy and how they relate to the
                       design of  oating objects.

                       Analyze the factors that contribute to an object's stability and ability
                       to  oat, such as weight and surface area.

                       Apply the principles of buoyancy and weight vs surface area to design
                       and optimize a  oating device.
