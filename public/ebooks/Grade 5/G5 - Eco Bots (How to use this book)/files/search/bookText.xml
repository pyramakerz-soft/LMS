             How to use this book?






                             This book engages students through storytelling,
                             connecting STEAM education with the Sustainable
                             Development Goals (SDGs). It demonstrates how science,
                             technology, engineering, art, and math can be applied to
                             tackle global challenges, focusing on SDGs 14 ,12 ,6, and 15.


                             The project centers around a water waste  oater
                             designed to monitor and reduce water pollution in urban
                             environments. The project promotes responsible
                             consumption and recycling (SDG 12) with advanced water
                             treatment and waste separation systems, ensuring
                             sustainable resource use and reducing environmental
                             impact.


                             SDG 6 (Clean Water and Sanitation) is addressed through
                             the  oater's role in keeping water clean by detecting and
                              ltering pollutants before they reach waterways,
                             improving public health and sustainability.


                             The  oater supports SDG 14 (Life Below Water) by reducing
                             waste in rivers and oceans, thus protecting marine
                             biodiversity and maintaining aquatic ecosystems.

                             This project encourages students to explore how
                             innovative technologies, like the water waste  oater, can
                             address pressing environmental issues related to water,
                             land, and marine conservation, promoting a healthier and
                             more sustainable future for both people and the planet.]]></page><page Index="3"><![CDATA[Stepping Stone:

                       of ecosystems.


                       Discuss the importance of protecting and preserving  ecosystems to
                       maintain biodiversity and ecological sustainability.


                       Investigate the physical and mechanical properties of di erent

                       Determine the suitability of various materials for constructing objects
                       based on their properties.

                       Explain the relationship between an object's density and its ability to
                        oat or sink in water.


                       Understand the principles of buoyancy and how they relate to the
                       design of  oating objects.

                                                                               I'm so excited! "I'm going

                                                                                 Mom

                   Adam ran toward the
                   water, his feet sinking
                   into the warm sand.
                   He built sandcastles,
                   collected seashells, and
                   played in the waves.

                   After a while, he
                   decided to take a walk
                   along the shoreline,
                   curious to see what
                   treasures the sea might
                   have washed up.





                                                                               As he strolled along the

                                                                                Adam

                                                                               He knelt down and saw a

               That felt really good, but

               He spent the rest of the

               found on the beach.

              Let's step into the role of environmental
              engineers and, let’s brainstorm solutions and
              structures to purify water and collect waste.

                                                       -  Things  oat or sink in water based on their
                                                          density. If something has more density than
                                                          water, it will sink. If it has less density than

                                                       -  Density is mass of a unit volume of a material
                                                          substance.

                                                       -  The formula for density is d = M/V, where d is
                                                          density, M is mass, and V is volume.

                                                       -  The standard units of density are kg/m3 and

                       doesn't soak up water.

                 After deciding your materials, now let’s
                 choose the best design for your  oater.




              Steps to follow…



              -  Create a few models of the same
                 shape but di erent sizes.
                 Design it so both sides are mirror
                 images.
              -  Think of a solid block of wood versus
                 a hollow log.
              -  Find the perfect balance between
                  oating high and staying steady!
              -  By adding di erent weight on them.
              -  Test them in a bathtub.

                 Okay class your friends Adam and
                 Laila need the help of some clever and
                 creative minds to design a propeller
                 that would make the  outer zoom
                 across the water and move smoothly

               What is a key factor in designing a propeller           Which blade shape might reduce
               for the Flouter?                                        drag and increase e ciency?
                 a) Color.              c) Size of the vehicle.          a) Straight.   c) Square.
                 b) Number of blades. d) Type of fuel.                   b) Curved.     d) Triangular.

               How does the number of blades a ect a propeller's performance?
                  a) More blades always make it faster.
                  b) Fewer blades make it more colorful.
                  c) The number of blades can a ect stability and thrust.
                  d) More blades make it heavier.
