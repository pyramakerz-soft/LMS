             How to use this book?









                           In this book, students embark on an exciting journey to uncover the
                           causes and eects of climate change and explore how technology can
                           help us detect and respond to its impacts. Through the lens of STEAM
                           education, they’ll discover how science, technology, engineering, art,
                           and math converge to address one of the most pressing global
                           challenges of our time.

                           The book introduces a hands-on project where students create their
                           own climate monitoring systems, integrating tools like sensors and data
                           analysis. Through engaging activities and real-world applications,
                           they’ll learn how technological advancements can track environmental
                           changes, linking these ideas with Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)
                           7 (Aordable and Clean Energy), 13 (Climate Action), and 15 (Life on
                           Land).

                           In one section, students dive into SDG 7 by exploring how clean energy
                           solutions like solar and wind power contribute to reducing carbon
                           emissions. As they build simple energy-ecient systems, they’ll
                           understand the connection between renewable energy and mitigating
                           climate change’s impact.

                           At the SDG 13 station, students investigate the science of climate
                           change, analyzing data from temperature sensors, CO2 trackers, and
                           weather patterns. By designing and programming their own devices,
                           they’ll develop problem-solving skills and learn how technological tools
                           can help monitor climate-related phenomena such as rising
                           temperatures, melting ice caps, and extreme weather events.

                           Finally, focusing on SDG 15, the book highlights how technology can
                           protect ecosystems. Students will explore how tools like drones and
                           satellite imagery can track deforestation, monitor wildlife habitats,
                           and assess soil health, linking technology to the conservation of
                           biodiversity and sustainable land use.

                           This journey through climate change and technology emphasizes the
                           vital role of innovation in tackling global challenges. Students gain a
                           deeper understanding of environmental science, engineering, and
                           sustainability, inspiring them to create solutions for a healthier planet.
                           Through this engaging, story-driven approach, they’ll be empowered to
                           imagine new ways technology can help protect Earth and its future.

                           Dene global warming and explain its main causes, including the role of
                           human activities such as burning fossil fuels and deforestation.

                           Describe the greenhouse eect and its contribution to global warming,
                           using key terms like "carbon dioxide" and "greenhouse gases."
                           Identify the environmental impacts of global warming, including rising
                           temperatures, melting glaciers, and changing weather patterns.

                           Explore and suggest solutions to reduce global warming, such as
                           conserving energy, planting trees, and using renewable resources.


                           Recognize the importance of global action and how individual eorts
                           contribute to addressing climate change.

                           Design and sketch a prototype for a climate change mitigation device,
                           then create a 3D digital model using Tinkercad.
                           Integrate sensors like water level, temperature, or humidity sensors into
                           the device and explain their functions and signicance.

                           Collect and interpret sensor data to understand environmental changes,
                           such as shifts in temperature and humidity, and propose actionable
                           responses.

                           Program sensors using basic coding principles to enable automated
                           responses and alerts, such as warnings for abnormal environmental
                           readings.

                           Connect a temperature sensor to a Bluetooth module and program it to
                           wirelessly transmit data to a mobile application interface.


                           Develop a basic mobile app to display sensor data, demonstrating the
                           principles of wireless data communication and its practical applications.

                           Create a basic webpage using HTML to raise awareness about climate
                           change, incorporating tags for headings, paragraphs, lists, and images.
                           Format and enhance the webpage using simple HTML tags for bold.

                 Hello friends! Today, we’re doing a fun experiment to
                 learn about global warming.


                 You’ll need 2 bottles, 2 thermometers, water, vinegar,
                 and baking soda.

                1.  Fill one bottle with water, place a thermometer inside, close it,
                    and put it in the sun.
                2.  In the other bottle, add vinegar, baking soda, and a
                    thermometer, then close it and put it in the sun.



                Write down what you see happening in each bottle and think
                about what it means. Let’s discover together!

               pet's collar could communicate with each other! IoT
               makes this possible by connecting these items to the
               internet so they can share information.

               For example, a smart thermostat can let you know if
               your house is too hot or too cold.

                D) A type of computer hardware used to store data.








                                          How do websites work?


                                             Design.
                                             The design process includes planning the layout,
                                             choosing colors and fonts, and organizing content to
                                             create an appealing and user-friendly experience.

                                             View.

                                             Web Browsers: When a user enters a website's URL in
                                             a web browser, the browser sends a request to the
                                             server hosting that website. The server then sends
                                             back the necessary les for the browser to display
                                             the page.

                                             Interaction: Users interact with the website by
                                             clicking links, lling out forms, and scrolling through
                                             content. The design guides these interactions,
                                             making it easy for users to nd information or
                                             complete tasks online.
