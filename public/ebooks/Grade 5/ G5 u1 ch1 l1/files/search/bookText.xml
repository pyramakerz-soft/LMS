                                                                               I'm so excited! "I'm going

                                                                                 Mom

                   Adam ran toward the
                   water, his feet sinking
                   into the warm sand.
                   He built sandcastles,
                   collected seashells, and
                   played in the waves.

                   After a while, he
                   decided to take a walk
                   along the shoreline,
                   curious to see what
                   treasures the sea might
                   have washed up.





                                                                               As he strolled along the

                                                                               the water's edge.

                                                                                Adam

                                                                               He knelt down and saw a

               That felt really good, but

               He spent the rest of the

               plastic and trash he
               found on the beach.
