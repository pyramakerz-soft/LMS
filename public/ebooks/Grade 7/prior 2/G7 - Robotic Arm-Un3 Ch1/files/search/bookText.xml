             1. How can "IF-THEN-ELSE" conditions make your robotic arm
             smarter?

                A) By making the arm heavier.
                B) By allowing the arm to follow speci c instructions based on conditions.
                C) By making the arm move faster.
                D) By increasing the arm's battery life.


             2. How can you record and control your robotic arm’s actions
             through code?


                A) By writing a program that tracks and executes speci c movements.
                B) By using a pencil to draw the movements.
                C) By pressing random buttons.
                D) By changing the arm's shape.
