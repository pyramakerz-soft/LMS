Tech Time Travellers: Designing a Next-Gen Interactive Museum                      Introduction                     Imagine visiting a museum where you control the experience! Instead                    of just looking at monuments, you can interact with them and steer a                    high-tech exhibit car that takes you through famous landmarks. The                    city government, supported by the Ministry of Tourism, is building this                    high-tech museum to engage residents and tourists alike. Your mission:                    help design an interactive exhibit that integrates robotics, 3D                    modeling, and mobile apps to make history come alive!                      Mission                     You are the museum tech designer! The Ministry of Tourism seeks                    innovative ideas to attract tourists and preserve cultural history. Your                    task is to create an interactive exhibit where visitors can control a                    mobile museum car using their phones to navigate through replicas of                    world-famous monuments. You'll design these monuments in 3D, build a                    robotic car, and develop a mobile app to control it—all while boosting                    tourism and cultural preservation.                      Scenario Context                     Who: The city government and the Ministry of Tourism are teaming up                    with engineers, architects, and tech experts to create a futuristic,                    interactive museum.                    What: Design a mobile, interactive car that moves between exhibits,                    allowing visitors to explore replicas of famous monuments using a                    mobile app you’ll develop.                    Where: The museum will be located in, a city renowned for its cultural                    heritage, and will showcase global monuments alongside its historical                    landmarks.
