                Project Overview





                Adam and Laila's school organized a  eld trip to an industrial
                area where they visited one of the factories.


                As they observed the workers, they noticed that the workers
                were struggling to lift and move heavy objects.



                The process was not only
                time-consuming but also
                costly due to the manual
                labor involved.


                Adam and Laila realized
                that this was a problem
                that could be solved with

                a smart solution, and
                they were determined to
                help the factory workers
                improve their e ciency.
