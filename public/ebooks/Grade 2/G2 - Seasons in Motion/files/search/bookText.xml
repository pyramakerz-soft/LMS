             How to use this book?









                             This book engages students through storytelling, connecting STEAM
                             education with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

                             It illustrates how science, technology, engineering, art, and math can
                             be applied to explore the four seasons and tackle global challenges,
                             focusing on SDGs 11 ,7, and 13.


                             Through a vibrant four seasons carnival simulation, students will
                             experience the changing climates of spring, summer, autumn, and
                             winter, while understanding how these natural cycles impact our
                             world.

                             The carnival features themed stations, each representing a season,
                             where students learn how to adapt to seasonal changes using smart
                             technology and sustainable solutions.


                             The spring station promotes SDG 7 (Aordable and Clean Energy) by
                             showcasing how renewable energy, like solar panels and wind
                             turbines, can be used to power homes and schools as daylight hours
                             increase.


                             Summer stations emphasize SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities and
                             Communities), Autumn and winter stations address SDG 13 (Climate
                             Action).

                             By linking the beauty and cycles of the four seasons to sustainable
                             development, this book shows how creating eco-friendly, adaptive
                             communities can contribute to a healthier planet.

                             It invites students to reimagine how seasonal changes shape our
                             world, and how they can take action to protect and preserve the
                             environment for future generations.

              Let's play the Tree Game! I'll guide you
              through it.


              Here’s how it works:

              1. I have a list of cards. Each card has an
                  object or symbol representing a
                  specic season (spring, summer,
                  autumn, or winter).

              2. For each card, I’ll reveal the object,
                  and you’ll decide where it should go on
                  the seasons tree (spring, summer,
                  autumn, or winter).

              3. Based on your choice, you will "take" a
                  token and place it in the appropriate
                  spot on the tree.

                What You’ll Need:
