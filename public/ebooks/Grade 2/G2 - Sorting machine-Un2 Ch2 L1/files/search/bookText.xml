                   You need to know …                     You will be able to…

                          What are materials?

                          The parts of the sorting               explore which materials are attracted
                          machine they are going to              to magnets and which are not (e.g.,
                          make.                                  magnetic vs. non-magnetic materials).

               Alright, kids, the most important step—let’s add
               the magnet to help us with the sorting.
                 Laila   Mrs. Sara, what is a magnet,
                         and why do we need it?
               At this point, Mrs. Sara began to tell them a story
               about the magnet.

                                                                  who lived in Magnesia, Greece.

                                          I got it! So, the magnet will help us pull the
                                          metals.
