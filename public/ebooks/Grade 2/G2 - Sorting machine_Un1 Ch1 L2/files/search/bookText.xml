                 Mrs. Sara, I have an
                 idea!
                 Why don’t we create a
                 machine that can do
                 that for us?

                   Mrs. sara

                 Great idea, Laila!
                 Let’s think about how
                 we can do that.











                 To solve our problem, we need to plan
                 our ideas and use the engineering
                 design process.


                 This will help us stay focused
                 organized, and  nd the best solution.
