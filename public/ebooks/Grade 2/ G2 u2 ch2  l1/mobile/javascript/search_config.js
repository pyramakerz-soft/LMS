Mrs. sara                 Alright, kids, the most important step—let’s add                the magnet to help us with the sorting.                  Laila   Mrs. Sara, what is a magnet,                          and why do we need it?                At this point, Mrs. Sara began to tell them a story                about the magnet.                                                                                There was once a shepherd named Magnes                                                                   who lived in Magnesia, Greece.                                                                    One day, Magnes was herding his sheep                                                                   through the mountains...                                                                               27","Suddenly, he noticed that the tip of his                 stick and the nails in his sandals got                 stuck to a rock.                                                                                        The iron in his stick and nails was attracted                                                                   to the magnetic rock.                                                                   The stone was named magnetite, after the                                                                   shepherd or the place where it was found.                                                                           Adam                                           I got it! So, the magnet will help us pull the                                           metals.                                             Mrs. sara                                           Great thinking, Adam! But actually, not all                                           metals.. Let’s discover this together.                                                                     28","Why do you think magnets                 let's                                         can pull things to it?                let's                                                               . ..............................................................................................................................................
