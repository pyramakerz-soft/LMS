The models                              encourage students to think critically about how                              transportation can contribute to achieving SDG 7                              (A­ordable and Clean Energy).                                Additionally, the book emphasizes the role of SDG 11                              (Sustainable Cities and Communities) by showcasing                              how well-planned public transportation networks,                              walkable cities, and bike paths can reduce tra c                              congestion and pollution. These transportation                              solutions ensure that urban spaces are more liveable                              and accessible for everyone, supporting both human                               health and environmental sustainability.                                By promoting e cient transportation systems and                              clean energy, the book encourages students to think                              creatively about how STEAM can be applied to solve                              modern transportation challenges, ensuring a                              sustainable and healthy environment for future                              generations.","UNIT 03         [Advanced]                                                 LESSON 01                              [Advanced]                                                                                         LESSON 01               UNIT 03                   Chapter 01 : Electricity.

A) Newton's First Law explains that the ride will remain at rest until an external force                  (motor) is applied, and the ride will stay in motion until friction or air resistance                  slows it down.               B) Newton's Second Law states that the force of the motor will cause the ride to                  accelerate, depending on the ride’s weight and the force exerted.               C) Newton's Third Law explains that for every action (force exerted by the motor),                  there is an equal and opposite reaction (the ride's movement).               D) All of the above.                 How do gears aect the motion of an amusement park ride like Tora Tora?               A) Gears increase the speed of the ride by reducing torque.               B) Gears allow the motor to provide more force to the ride by decreasing its speed.               C) Gears control the balance of the ride by regulating its acceleration.               D) Gears have no impact on the ride’s movement, they are only for aesthetic purposes.                 Which statement best explains how changing the gear ratio on the Tora               Tora ride impacts the motion?               A) Increasing the gear ratio makes the ride spin faster by reducing torque.               B) Decreasing the gear ratio makes the ride spin slower by increasing torque.               C) Changing the gear ratio does not aect the speed or force of the ride.               D) The gear ratio only aects the appearance of the ride and not its actual movement.                                                           1.  Newton's First Law (Inertia)                                                        An object stays at rest or keeps moving unless a                                                        force acts on it.                                                      2.  Newton's Second Law (Force and Acceleration)                                                        Acceleration depends on the force applied and the                                                        object's mass. The equation is:                                                        F = m × a                                                      3.  Newton's Third Law (Action and Reaction)                                                        For every action, there’s an equal and opposite                                                        reaction.                                                                 13","Practice                           Practice                  Adjust the gear ratio in the tora tora model to make the ride spin faster               or slower.

PCBs are used in                                               almost all electronic devices, such as computers,                                               phones, and TVs, because they make circuits compact,                                               reliable, and easy to produce.                                                                    13","Assessment Exercise                                    Focus                           Focus                    What was one of the main challenges with early electronic circuits that               led to the invention of printed circuit boards (PCBs)?               A) They were too simple to be eective.               B) They were dicult to repair and scale up due to manual wiring.               C) They were too expensive to manufacture.               D) They required too many components to function.                 Why is a resistive mask applied to the copper plate before etching in               the PC?                A) To enhance the color of the PCB.               B) To protect certain areas of the copper from being etched away.               C) To improve the mechanical strength of the PCB.               D) To facilitate the soldering of components.                Why is the solder mask typically green, and what is its primary               function?                A) It is green to match the aesthetic of electronic devices and prevents                   oxidation.               B) It is green to signify that the PCB is ready for assembly and protects                   against dust.
