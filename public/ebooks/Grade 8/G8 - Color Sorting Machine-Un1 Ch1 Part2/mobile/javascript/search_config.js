It's like                 a giant, endless loop.                   The Rollers: These are cylinders that support the belt and help it                 move smoothly.                 They're placed along the length of the conveyor.                  The Drive System: This is the motor that powers the conveyor belt.                 It makes the rollers turn, which moves the belt.                   The Frame: This is the structure that holds everything together,                 keeping the belt and rollers in place.                                                                     12","Assessment                                  Assessment                    Focus                      Which type of conveyor is speci cally designed for              transporting goods under special circumstances?
