                Project Overview





                Adam and Laila's school organized a  eld trip to an industrial
                area where they visited one of the factories.


                The candy factory has been experiencing a serious problem in
                the sorting department.



                The color sorter machine,
                which is responsible for
                separating di erent
                colored candies into their
                respective bins, has been
                malfunctioning.


                As a result, candies of

                various colors are getting
                mixed up, causing
                confusion and frustration
                for the workers. Adam
                and Laila realized that
                this was a problem that
                could be solved with
                colors sorting system.

               Let's step into the role of production engineers and,
               let’s brainstorm solutions and structures to know
               the solution for this problem.

               How do you think production engineers contribute
               to improve the economy?
