               Designing and Launching a City Amusement Park


                   Introduction

                   Imagine being part of a team of entrepreneurs tasked with creating
                   an exciting amusement park in your city! The local government is
                   committed to promoting entertainment and recreation, and they need
                   your help to design a park that will provide fun for families and
                   residents alike. As aspiring business owners, you will be responsible for
                   planning and creating key elements of the park, integrating concepts
                   from business planning, mechanics, electricity, and programming.


                   Mission

                   Your mission is to develop an innovative amusement park that o ers
                   thrilling attractions and engaging experiences for visitors of all ages.
                   You will design rides, create interactive elements, and ensure that your
                   park is safe, enjoyable, and sustainable. By combining creativity with
                   technical skills, you will bring your vision for this dynamic
                   entertainment space to life!




                   Scenario Context

                   Who: Entrepreneurs, local government o cials, residents, and
                   potential visitors.
                   What: The city is investing in a large-scale amusement park to enhance
                   local entertainment and provide recreational opportunities for the
                   community.
                   Where: A designated area within the city, chosen for its accessibility
                   and potential to attract visitors from nearby neighbourhoods.
                   When: The amusement park needs to be completed within 8 weeks, and
                   planning begins now.
                   Why: The city wants to create a fun and exciting space for families,
                   encouraging physical activity and enjoyment while enhancing the
                   quality of life for residents.

                 How can we plan, design, and build an amusement park that
                 incorporates thrilling attractions, e ective operational strategies,
                 and cutting-edge technology, while meeting the needs of the
                 community?

                 Objectives/Goals

                 1.  Understand the key elements of amusement parks: rides, attractions, services, safety,
                     and target audience.

                 2.  Learn the basics of entrepreneurship: business planning, investment, marketing, and risk
                     management.
                 3.  Understand the fundamentals of motion (speed, velocity, acceleration) as they apply to
                     ride designs.
                 4.  Apply Newton’s laws of motion and analyze forces (gravity, friction, centripetal force) in
                     the context of amusement rides.
                 5.  Explore the principles of energy (kinetic, potential) and their applications in amusement
                     ride design.
                 6.  Integrate motor drivers, DC motors, and other technologies to create operational systems
                     for the rides.
                 7.  Implement user controls, such as joysticks or touch screens, for interactive elements
                     within the park.
                 8.  Develop a website and mobile app to provide information about the amusement park, its
                     attractions, and special events.


                 Your Challenge


                 By the end of this project, you’ll have:
                   Designed a fully operational amusement park that includes a range
                   of rides and attractions.
                   Applied physics principles to ensure your rides are both thrilling and
                   safe, considering motion, forces, and energy.
                   Developed a business plan that outlines how the park will operate,
                   attract visitors, and manage  nances.
                   Built and tested a prototype ride using motors, sensors, and control
                   systems.
                   Created a website and mobile app that promote the park, o ering
                   information on attractions, ticket prices, and upcoming events.
                   Collaborated in teams as engineers, designers, and entrepreneurs to
                   complete the project.
                   Presented your park concept to a panel (teachers/peers) and
                   explained how it meets community needs and expectations.

              Which of the following correctly describes the application of Newton's
              Laws of Motion to the operation of a ride like Tora Tora?

              A) Newton's First Law explains that the ride will remain at rest until an external force
                 (motor) is applied, and the ride will stay in motion until friction or air resistance
                 slows it down.
              B) Newton's Second Law states that the force of the motor will cause the ride to
                 accelerate, depending on the ride’s weight and the force exerted.
              C) Newton's Third Law explains that for every action (force exerted by the motor),
                 there is an equal and opposite reaction (the ride's movement).
              D) All of the above.


              How do gears a ect the motion of an amusement park ride like Tora Tora?
              A) Gears increase the speed of the ride by reducing torque.
              B) Gears allow the motor to provide more force to the ride by decreasing its speed.
              C) Gears control the balance of the ride by regulating its acceleration.
              D) Gears have no impact on the ride’s movement, they are only for aesthetic purposes.


              Which statement best explains how changing the gear ratio on the Tora
              Tora ride impacts the motion?
              A) Increasing the gear ratio makes the ride spin faster by reducing torque.
              B) Decreasing the gear ratio makes the ride spin slower by increasing torque.
              C) Changing the gear ratio does not a ect the speed or force of the ride.
              D) The gear ratio only a ects the appearance of the ride and not its actual movement.






                                                    1.  Newton's First Law (Inertia)
                                                       An object stays at rest or keeps moving unless a
                                                       force acts on it.

                                                    2.  Newton's Second Law (Force and Acceleration)
                                                       Acceleration depends on the force applied and the
                                                       object's mass. The equation is:
                                                       F = m × a

                                                    3.  Newton's Third Law (Action and Reaction)
                                                       For every action, there’s an equal and opposite
                                                       reaction.
