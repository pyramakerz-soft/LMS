                          Electricity (e.g., batteries,
                          circuits and motors).                   smartpad.


                          How to connect simple circuits         Make the truck move forward.
                          and how electricity  ows.

                Well, class, now that we've built our model
                truck, we need to think about how we can           Teacher
                make it move.
