             How to use this book?









                             This book takes students on an exciting journey through
                             storytelling, intertwining STEAM education with Sustainable
                             Development Goals (SDGs) to explore the food chain and its
                             vital role in ecosystems.

                             It illustrates how science, technology, engineering, art, and
                             math can deepen our understanding of energy
                             transformation in nature and the complex interconnections
                             that sustain life.


                             Emphasizing SDGs 13 ,12, and 15 (Responsible Consumption and
                             Production, Climate Action, and Life on Land), this journey
                             highlights how even small disruptions in the food chain, such
                             as the disappearance of a single species, can ripple across the
                             environment, a ecting biodiversity and ecosystem balance.


                             Students will encounter an interactive food chain simulation,
                             where each station represents di erent ecosystems-forests,
                             oceans, grasslands, and wetlands. Here, students will observe
                             how energy  ows from the sun to plants, then to herbivores,
                             carnivores, and decomposers, completing a circle that
                             supports life.

                             Through hands-on activities and storytelling, they’ll discover
                             the delicate balance of predator and prey, producer and
                             consumer, and how each organism plays an irreplaceable role
                             in sustaining the environment.

                             By linking ecological harmony with sustainable development,
                             this book invites students to reimagine their role in protecting
                             our planet.

                             Students will explore how our choices impact the food chain
                             and discover ways to safeguard the environment,
                             encouraging them to become stewards of a balanced,
                             thriving world for generations to come.

               What happens to pandas when bamboo forests disappear?

               A)  They  nd other food easily.
               B)  They might lose their main source of food.
               C)  They move to the desert to  nd food.
               D)  They stop needing food to survive.


               Why is it important to protect bamboo forests?
               A)  To make the jungle game more fun.
               B)  Because they provide food for pandas and are part of the ecosystem.
               C)  To use the bamboo to build houses.
               D)  So that pandas can live alone in the forest.

                                       Imagine a nature's dinner party! There are plants,
                                       animals that eat plants, and animals that eat those
                                       plant-eaters. It's like a chain, and if one part is missing,
                                       the whole chain gets wobbly.
                                       When animals lose their homes or get hunted too much,
                                       they become endangered. This breaks the nature's chain,
                                       and other animals get a ected too. We need to protect
                                       them to keep the balance and a healthy planet!

              Create a Poster About Endangered
              Animals!




               1.  Choose an Endangered Animal: Pick one or
                  two endangered animals you like (e.g.,
                  panda, tiger, sea turtle).

               2.  Add Pictures: Draw or print pictures of the
                  animals and glue them onto your poster.

               3.  Write About the Animal: Add a few
                  sentences about the animals. Where do they
                  live? What do they eat? Why are they
                  important?

               4.  Explain the Danger: Write what makes them
                  endangered. Is it habitat loss, hunting,
                  pollution, or something else?

               5.  Add Ideas to Help: Write or draw what
                  people can do to protect these animals. For
                  example, planting trees, cleaning up litter,
                  or making safe spaces for them.

               6.  Make It Colorful: Use bright colors to make
                  your poster stand out!

               Yesterday, you came up with
               some amazing designs for your
               animal protection areas. Today,
               we're going to take it a step
               further. We're going to build the
               physical models of your designs!"

               start?"

               Mrs. Sara: "Just like engineers,
               after coming up with a design,
               the next step is to create a
               prototype, or a small version of
               your idea. This will help us see if
               it works and if we need to make

                                                 Imagine a tiny, magic switch. This switch is so
                                                 small, you can barely see it!
                                                 We call it a micro-limit switch.

                                                 How does it work?

                                                    It's a touchy switch: It turns on or ofhen
                                                    something touches it, it turns on or o .


                                                    It's like a gate: It can open or close a door,
                                                    turn on or o  a light, or even start a
                                                    machine.

              What is a micro limit switch?
              A) A big, heavy switch.
              B) A tiny switch that turns on or o  when touched.
              C) A switch that makes loud noises.


              Why do toy cars have micro limit switches?

              A) To make them look cool.
              B) To help them stop when they hit something.
              C) To make them go faster.

              Replace the on/o  switch
              with a limit switch to control
              the LED.

               Adam, can you remove one of

               *Adam gently lifted one of the
