How to use this book?                                    This book engages students through storytelling,                               connecting STEAM education with the Sustainable                              Development Goals (SDGs). It demonstrates how                              science, technology, engineering, art, and math can be                              applied to tackle global challenges, focusing on SDGs                              11 ,7, and 15.                                The smart city features well-planned roads,                              sidewalks, and bike paths to ensure safety, and                               promotes the use of buses and electric cars to reduce                              pollution. It emphasizes recycling through the use of                              bins and compost areas, alongside smart buildings                              that use energy e ciently and provide comfortable                              living spaces.                                Additionally, the book highlights the importance of                              SDG 15 (Life on Land) by incorporating green spaces                              such as parks, gardens, and tree-lined streets within                              the smart city. These areas not only enhance the                              beauty and livability of the city but also support                              biodiversity by providing habitats for plants and                               animals.                                By promoting sustainable land use and reducing urban                              sprawl, the smart city helps protect ecosystems and                              maintain the balance of life on land, ensuring a                              healthier environment for future generations.                                                                              01","Stepping Stone:                       Where we merge your existing                   knowledge with exciting new discoveries                                   1.
