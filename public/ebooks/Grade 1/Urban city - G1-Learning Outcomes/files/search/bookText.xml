                           Identify and name key technologies present in

                           smart cities.


                           Recognize and make basic two-dimensional shapes
                           (e.g. Circles, squares) and three-dimensional shapes
                           (e.g., cubes, spheres).


                           Describe how smart cities use resources wisely,
                           keep things clean, and use less energy to help the

                           Earth.


                           Explain the di erence between analog and digital
                           clocks and how to read them.


                           Use Apps and technology tools to practice telling
                           time and exploring shapes interactively.


                           Compare and contrast the vertices, edges, and
                           faces of di erent three-dimensional shapes.


                           Evaluate the e ectiveness of their tra c light

                           models in demonstrating how to solve road
                           accidents at crossroads and smart alarm in cross
                           section.
