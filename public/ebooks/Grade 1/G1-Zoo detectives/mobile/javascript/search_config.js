Mrs. Sara:                 Great job so far, kids!                   Laila:                 But, Mrs. Sara, can we                 change the color to                 match the temperature                 where the animals live?                   Mrs. Sara:                 That’s a wonderful idea,                 Laila! Yes, we can do                 that. Maybe we can  add                 an LED matrix.                   Adam and Laila                 look at each other, a bit                 confused about what an                 LED matrix is.                                                                          35","What colors could we use                 let's                                              on our lights to show hot                  let's                                                                    and cold places where                                                                    animals live?

Think about where it lives—some animals live in hot                   places, and some live in cold places!                    Pick a color to match the animal’s home.                   For example, if you see a polar bear, choose a cool color                   like blue.                   Press a button (or ask your teacher) to light up the LED                   matrix with the color you picked!                   Try making patterns on the LED matrix!                   You could place two blue lights together for a cold place                   or mix red and blue for a colorful design.                        WATCH IT..
