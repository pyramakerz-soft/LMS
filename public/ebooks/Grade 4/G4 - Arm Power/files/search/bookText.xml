             How to use this book?









                           In this book, students embark on an exciting journey to explore the
                           human skeletal system and the engineering behind building a robotic
                           arm. Through the lens of STEAM education, they’ll discover how science,
                           technology, engineering, art, and math can work together to help us
                           understand our own anatomy while learning to design functional
                           robotic systems inspired by human movement.

                           The book introduces a hands-on project where students create their
                           own robotic arm. Through engaging activities and real-world
                           applications, they’ll explore how the skeletal system supports and
                           enables movement, linking these ideas with Sustainable Development
                           Goals (SDGs) 3 (Good Health and Well-being), 4 (Quality Education), and 9
                           (Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure).

                           In one section, students explore SDG 3 by examining the importance of
                           the skeletal system for human health, including bone health and injury
                           prevention. As they understand the mechanics of joints and levers,
                           they’ll draw connections between how bones and joints work together
                           to create movement and how a robotic arm mimics these movements.

                           At the SDG 4 station, students are encouraged to innovate by learning
                           foundational engineering and coding skills to operate their robotic
                           arms, linking these skills to real-world STEM careers and applications.
                           By working through challenges in constructing and programming their
                           robotic arms, students will gain insights into both human anatomy and
                           the basics of robotics.

                           Finally, focusing on SDG 9, the book connects technological
                           advancements to sustainable infrastructure. Students are inspired to
                           think about how robotic technology can assist in elds like healthcare
                           and industry, creating sustainable solutions that improve lives and
                           communities.

                           This journey through the skeletal system and robotics highlights the
                           powerful relationship between our bodies and technology, showing
                           students how knowledge in both elds can contribute to a better, more
                           innovative future. Through this engaging, story-driven approach,
                           students gain a deeper understanding of anatomy, engineering, and
                           sustainability, empowering them to imagine new ways to improve
                           health and industry.

                 You neet to know…                               You will be able to…


                         Simple machines like levers.                   Understand how the arm acts
                                                                        as a lever system.

                         Forces can change how things                   Recognize force and torque.
                         move, like making objects go
                         faster or slower.






             After deciding to build a robot arm to show
             how muscles connect to bones, Ali had an idea.
             Ali: "Laila, did you know our muscles work like
             levers to move bones? Let me show you."
             He used a ruler and pencil to demonstrate how
             a lever works, explaining that the joints act as
             fulcrums and muscles pull to create movement.

             Laila (excited): "So, we can add joints and use
             strings as muscles to make the robot arm
             move!"
             Ali nodded. "Exactly! Let’s start building and
             test it out."

              A) A measure of speed.
              B) A twisting force.
              C) A unit of time.

              A) Torque is the force that muscles apply to levers.
              B) Levers are used to reduce torque.
              C) Torque is not related to levers or the human body.

                   These simple machines can help us mimic the
                   exibility and strength of a human arm.

                                            Series Circuit:
                                            A series circuit is a type of electrical circuit in which all the
                                            components are connected in a single path. The current
                                            ows through each component one after the other.
                                            If one component stops working, the entire circuit is broken.

                                            Parallel Circuit:
                                            A parallel circuit is a type of electrical circuit where
                                            components are connected across multiple paths. The
                                            current splits and ows through each path separately.
                                            If one component stops working, the others continue to work
                                            because the circuit is not completely broken.

                   With our robotic arm now powered and moving
                   thanks to the electricity and circuits, it’s time to
                   take the next step-creating a hand that can grasp
                   and hold objects.

                   Just like engineers design machines to be both
                   functional and ecient, we’ll focus on building a
                   hand that not only works seamlessly with the arm
                   but also looks purposeful and practical.

                   Let’s dive into the exciting challenge of designing
                   and constructing a moving hand to bring our
                   robotic arm to life!

             The next morning, Laila met Adam to tell him
             about the project.

             Laila began, "Adam, I’ve been working on a
             really exciting project! I’ve built a prototype
             for a robotic arm with Ali"
             Adam, curious, asked, "That sounds
             awesome! What’s the next step?"

             Laila replied, "Now that the prototype is
             done, we need to design a hand that can
             move and hold things.


             Adam nodded. "That’s a great plan. What
             should we use to design it?"


             Laila thought for a moment and said, "What
             about Tinkercad? We can create the design
             there, and then ask Mrs. Sara to print it for
             us with her 3D printer."

             Adam, excited by the idea, smiled. "That’s a
             smart approach. Let’s get started!"

             Ali: "Alright, Laila, we're done!
             You and adam did a great job
             the hand is moving perfectly."
             Laila: "But I feel like we could
             do something more..."


             Laila: "Hmm, oh, I know! What
             if we made it work like Siri,
             where it listens to orders?
             That way, omar could just tell
             the hand what to do, and it
             would move!"

             Ali (excited): "That's a
             brilliant idea, Laila! We can
             create a mobile app so Omar
             can control the arm using his
             voice. Let’s add that to our
             project!"
