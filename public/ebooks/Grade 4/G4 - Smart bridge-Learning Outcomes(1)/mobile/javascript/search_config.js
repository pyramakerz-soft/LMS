Identify and measure di erent types of angles                            (right, acute, obtuse) using protractors, and apply                             this knowledge to ensure structural integrity and                            optimal load distribution.                              Practice basic programming with Arduino to control                            sensors and collect data.                              Apply the engineering design process to design,                            build, test, and improve the smart bridge, working                            collaboratively in teams and developing                            communication skills.                               Combine math skills with engineering and                            technology in a hands-on project.                              Understanding how accuracy is important in                            building and using technology in real life.                                                                           04"];
