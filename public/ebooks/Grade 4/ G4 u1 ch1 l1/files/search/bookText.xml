                 While visiting Laila’s grandfather,
                 Adam and Laila ran into a
                 problem:
                 it took a really long time to cross
                 the river, Feeling frustrated.
                         jokingly said,
                 "Maybe we should just swim
                 across!"
                          laughed and said,
                 "That’s not safe! We need to nd
                 a better way to get across.

                  Grandfather
                 "Back in my day, we
                 used simple wooden
                 bridges, but oods
                 often washed them
                 away.

                         added:
                 "But if we build a
                 bridge, boats won’t
                 be able to pass.

                 Laila then
                 suggested, So let's
                 make a strong,
                 movable bridge.
