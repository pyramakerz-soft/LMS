                 went to visit my
                 grandfather in the
                 village.
                 My friend Adam and I
                 wanted to cross the river,
                 but there was no bridge!
                 We started thinking
                 about how cool it would
                 be to build a bridge that
                 could move and help
                 everyone.

               What was the main goal of the bridge design?             follow the engineering design
               Why did they want to create a movable bridge?            process.
