Recall the basic functions of each  re truck                        component.                          Create 3D models of  re truck parts using Fusion                         360 software.                          Apply mechanical design principles to develop                        accurate and functional prototypes.                           Synthesize knowledge and skills to construct a fully                        functional  re truck model.                           Describe how temperature sensors work and their                        role in detecting  res.                          Explain the basic principles of GPS technology and                         its application in emergency response.                          Analyse the interaction between temperature                        sensors, GPS modules, and the  re truck model.                                                                            04"];
