What is the primary function of a relay in an Arduino project?               A) To increase the speed of the Arduino's processor.              B) To control high-power devices with low-power Arduino outputs.              C) To store data in non-volatile memory.              D) To improve the Arduino's wireless communication range.               2. The main purpose of a water pump is to:              A) Move water from a higher level to a lower one.              B) Move water from a lower level to a higher one.              C) Compress water.              D) Transfer water between two points and remove excess water.               3. What type of energy conversion occurs in water pumps?               A) Thermal energy into electrical energy.              B) Mechanical energy into chemical energy.              C) Electrical energy into mechanical energy.              D) Kinetic energy into potential energy.

Since the controller outputs 24Volts AC power, and               most pumps require anywhere from 220-110 Volts              AC, the pump relay acts as a step-up transformer to               route additional power to the pump and activate it.
