How to use this book?                                     This book engages students through storytelling,                              connecting STEAM education with the Sustainable                              Development Goals (SDGs). It demonstrates how science,                              technology, engineering, art, and math can be applied to                              address global challenges, focusing on SDGs 11 ,9 ,7, and 13.                                The project centers around a smart  re truck designed to                              respond to emergencies with precision and sustainability                              in mind.
