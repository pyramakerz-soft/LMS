Later that day, Mrs.                   Sara announced the                   science fair to the                   students.                   Suddenly, an idea                   popped into Adam’s                   mind—he decided to                   make a smart  re                   truck for his project                   and asked Laila to                   work with him.                              In order for Adam to make the project                  and solve the problem, Adam and                  laila need to organize their ideas and                  follow the engineering design process.                    This will help them stay organized                   and  nd a successful solution!                                                                        11","Use the EDP paper for                        let's                        let's                                                       brain storming to create                      Think                            the project.
