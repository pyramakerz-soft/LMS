                                                                                           LESSON 02











                                                                              When Adam and Laila
                                                                              returned to school,
                                                                              they began sharing
                                                                              stories with their
                                                                              friends about what
                                                                              happened at the camp.











                  Later that day, Mrs.
                  Sara announced the
                  science fair to the
                  students.
                  Suddenly, an idea
                  popped into Adam’s
                  mind—he decided to
                  make a smart  re
                  truck for his project
                  and asked Laila to
                  work with him.












                 In order for Adam to make the project
                 and solve the problem, Adam and
                 laila need to organize their ideas and
                 follow the engineering design process.


                 This will help them stay organized

                 and  nd a successful solution!
