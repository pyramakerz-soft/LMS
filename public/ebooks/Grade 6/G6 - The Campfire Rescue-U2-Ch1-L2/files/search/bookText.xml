                 Connect the  ame

                 sensor to the

                 Arduino to make a
                 circuit, and then

                 write the code for it.

             What is the primary function of a  ame sensor?

             A) To detect the presence of a  ame.
             B) To control the  ame intensity.
             C) To measure the temperature of the  ame.
             D) To ignite the fuel.

             Now, add a buzzer to the circuit to create an alarm.






                Now I can…





                        Understand relay and how to use it with water pump.




                        Understand how the  ame sensor detect  re.




                        Connect a relay module and a  ame sensor to an
                        Arduino, and to write the code to control them.
