             1. What creates the pressure in a  re truck's hose?

             A) Heat.
             B) Gravity.
             C) Pumps.
             D) Wind.

             2. Why do  re trucks need high  uid pressure?
             A) To make the truck go faster.
             B) To reach  res in tall buildings.
             C) To cool down the engine.
             D) To clean the streets.

             3. What happens to the water pressure when
             you squeeze the end of a hose?


             A) It decreases.
             B) It increases.
             C) It stays the same.
             D) It disappears.

             Select the best diameter for your hose,
             choose the right material, and begin
             creating it.
