How to use this book?                                     In this book, students begin an exciting journey to explore the human                            circulatory system and the engineering behind creating a                            pulse-checking machine. Through the lens of STEAM education, they’ll                            discover how science, technology, engineering, art, and math work                            together to help us understand the human body while learning to design                            functional devices inspired by real-world medical applications.                             The book introduces a hands-on project where students create their                            own pulse-checking machine. Through engaging activities and                            real-world applications, they’ll delve into how the circulatory system                            operates, linking these ideas with Sustainable Development Goals                            (SDGs) 3 (Good Health and Well-being), 4 (Quality Education), and 9                            (Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure).                             In one section, students explore SDG 3 by examining the importance of                            the circulatory system for maintaining human health. They’ll learn how                            the heart pumps blood, how to measure pulse rates, and why                            monitoring cardiovascular health is crucial. This foundational                            understanding will help them design their pulse-checking machines and                            explore its potential health applications.                             At the SDG 4 station, students are encouraged to innovate by learning                            basic engineering and coding skills required to build and operate their                            pulse-checking devices. These skills are directly tied to real-world STEM                            careers and demonstrate how technology can be used to enhance                            healthcare outcomes.                             Finally, focusing on SDG 9, the book connects technological                            advancements to sustainable healthcare infrastructure. Students are                            inspired to think about how medical technologies like pulse-checking                            devices can contribute to early diagnosis, e cient patient care, and                            overall community well-being.                             This journey through the circulatory system and medical engineering                            highlights the powerful relationship between biology and technology.

Did you know that the                                                    movement of blood can be explained using                                                    some cool physics laws?

Boyle’s Law:                                                    When the pressure on a gas goes down, its                                                    volume gets bigger. When the pressure goes                                                    up, the volume gets smaller.                                                      Bernoulli’s Equation:                                                    When a  uid moves faster, its pressure                                                    becomes lower. If the  uid slows down, its                                                    pressure increases.                                                                                   17","Assessment Exercise                                    Focus                           Focus                      https://www.purposegames.com/game/pulmona               ry-and-systemic-circulation-game                                                                                               Scan Here!
