                  Once upon a time, Adam and Laila
                  went on a camping trip  lled with fun
                  activities like hiking, swimming, and
                  storytelling by the camp re.

















                                                                   One evening, after a day of exploration
                                                                   and playing, Adam and Laila gathered
                                                                   around the camp re with their friends
                                                                   and camp counsellors.





                 Suddenly, Laila noticed something
                 alarming..
                   Laila
                 look! There's smoke coming from the
                 woods!"
                 she exclaimed, pointing towards a thick
                 column of smoke rising in the distance..
                 The camp counsellors quickly sprang into
                 action, but the  re was spreading fast.










                                                                    Adam called the  re station and
                                                                    explained the situation.. The operator
                                                                    asked,
                                                                    "Can you tell us what kind of  re it is?"
                                                                     Adam

                                                                    Unsure about its type, felt confused.

               common materials like paper, wood, and fabric.

               These are the electric eels of  res – they involve

               electrical equipment like faulty wires or appliances.
               They can be dangerous because they involve electricity!
